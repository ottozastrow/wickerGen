# wickerGen
this tool can be used to generate 3d wicker patterns for building components. At our University, the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, we will use this to weave willow branches with a fleet of robots driving on the floor, each holding a branch.

The tool computes the pattern based on knot positions and knot connections which are given as input.
